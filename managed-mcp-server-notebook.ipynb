With Databricks, you don’t need to build these connections yourself — the managed MCP servers let your agents quickly plug into Unity Catalog data, vector search, and custom functions.

Below, we're showing how you can immdeately test the managed MCP server such Genie in AI Playground with a model endpoint of your choice.

In future, you'd be able to also export the notebook code from the playground as normally is possible for non-MCP agentic applications. Additionally, you could also expose the Genie capabilities to external client application such as Claude Desktop.

However if you building a multi-agentic system and you need to share the capabilities across either coming from Databricks Managed MCP servers or you need to do some additional external API calls (custom MCPs) then exposing these as tools in a MCP server would be very efficient for your agentic system."
