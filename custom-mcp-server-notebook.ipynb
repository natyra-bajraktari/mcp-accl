To get started with the Databricks apps, for our example we have been following the steps from [here](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/mcp/custom-mcp#host-an-mcp-server-as-a-databricks-app), by creating the [three main files]($./mcp-custom-server) neccessary for the Databricks Apps: \n",
    "\n",
    "- app.yaml - specifying the CLI command to run your server.\n",
    "- requirements.txt - adding all your Python dependencies to the server\n",
    "- server.py - adding all your custom code for your tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to deploy it to the Databricks Apps, you could either use the [command line](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/mcp/custom-mcp#upload-the-mcp-server-as-a-databricks-appr) or the [UI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/databricks-apps/get-started) and point to the directory with these files."

Further, we want to extend the capabilities of our agentic system by making the agent capable of quantifying a patient’s health risk by calling a risk API. The agent would be capable to retrieve recent lab results from an external source. Lastly, the agent would be also able to schedule a patient’s appointment with a scheduler system. These capabilities are provided as tools in our [server.py]($./mcp-custom-server/server.py) for our custom MCP server."
